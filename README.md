##Introduction
>This plugin is still under development.<br>
>For bugs or ideas, please use Issue.

This plugin provide new editor type for IntelliJ IDEA for viewing diagrams based on source code.
Generated diagram image is generated by [Yuml.me](https://yuml.me/)site.

##Basic usage
Create a new file with ***yumlme*** extension to enable a new editor tab (tab name: *YumlmeEditor*) which works with actually opened file and using source text like diagram definition.
During first opening of file, diagram is already generated, but for updated diagram (after source text change), use **Refresh** button.
> Diagram refreshing is not done automatically due to execution time of rest calls after each change action in source text.

Editor also contains image size scale bar, for zoom.

For diagram source examples, please see [this link](https://yuml.me/diagram/scruffy/class/samples).
>Note that each element defined by text has to end with ***,(comma)***.

##Example
1. Create a new empty project.
2. Create a new empty file: **example.yumlme**
3. Insert this text to created file:
  `// Cool Class Diagram,
   [Customer|-forname:string;surname:string|doShiz()]<>-orders*>[Order],
   [Order]++-0..*>[LineItem],
   [Order]-[note:Aggregate root{bg:wheat}]`
4. Select YumlmeEditor tab at the bottom of editor view.
